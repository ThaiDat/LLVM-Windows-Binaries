# LLVM-Windows-Binaries

**Latest built version: LLVM 10.0.1**

# Intro
Follow Wikipedia: The LLVM compiler infrastructure project is a set of compiler and toolchain technologies, which can be used to develop a front end for any programming language and a back end for any instruction set architecture. LLVM is designed around a language-independent intermediate representation (IR) that serves as a portable, high-level assembly language that can be optimized with a variety of transformations over multiple passes.

LLVM has limited support for Windows. There is no official 'fully' Windows binary release as of writing. To be able to use all of LLVM tools on Windows, we have to compile it ourselves. This task require some knowledge of CMake and is not straightforward.

# How to build
See instruction on LLVM official site

# What is this repo?
As building LLVM from source is not a simle task, I did it once and everyone (include me) could use it at any time.
